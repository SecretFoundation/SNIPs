# Secret Network Improvement Proposals (SNIPs)

These documents pertain to Token standards for building on Secret Network.

## Contributing

1. Review [SNIP-0](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-0.md)
2. Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.
3. Add your SNIP to your fork of the repository. Here is a [SNIP template](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SNIPs/blob/master/SNIP-template.md).
4. Submit a Pull Request here in the "SNIPs" repository.

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final SNIP. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new SNIP. If your SNIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that SNIP as follows: assets/your-snip-name. When linking to an image in the SNIP, use relative links such as ../assets/your-snip-name/image.png.

**Make sure the 'author' line of your SNIP contains your GitHub username.**

# SNIP-24 - Query permits for [SNIP-20](/SNIP-20.md) tokens

This document describes a querying method for SNIP-20 tokens that is superior to using viewing keys. Contracts that support the existing SNIP-20 standard are still considered compliant, and clients should be written to benefit from these features when available, but provide fallback for when these features are not available.

The feature specified in this document is an improved UX for the `Allowance`, `Balance`, `TransferHistory` & `TransactionHistory` queries, aimed at enriching SNIP-20 (and SNIP-721) tokens usage and onset for new users.

## Rationale

### The Problem with Viewing Keys

Viewing keys are passwords meant to validate users at times when the blockchain cannot. Specifically in queries, the query sender isn't authenticated and the contract doesn't know who is the querier. Therefore viewing keys were invented to provide a way of access control for users:

1. Alice sends a transaction `set_viewing_key(password)`
2. The contract stores `(alice,password)`
3. Later on, a query is sent to the contract `query("balance",alice,password)`
   - If `(alice,password)` matches what's in storage, the contract returns Alice's balance to the querier.

The main disadvantage of this method is that Alice must send a transaction before she can query her balance. This is bad UX for users new to Secret Network - Also because they have to pay SCRT gas to get a basic piece of information, but especially when traffic is high and nodes lag behind, queried nodes might have the `query("balance")` answer but can't authenticate the querier because the node still didn't catch up with the `set_viewing_key()` transaction.

### Query Permits

Query permits are an alternative way of authenticating the querier. Instead of storing a password in the contract's state, the users signs a piece of data with their private keys, and then sends this data and the signature to the contract along with the query. The contract then validates the signature against the data, and returns an answer if the signature is validated.

This way users don't have to send a transaction before they can access their data.

Also note that the querier doesn't send the account's address to the contract, as the contract derives it from the public key attached to the signature.

## Data Structures

The data structure for query permits was chosen to accommodate existing tools in the ecosystem, namely Keplr & secretd which already know how to sign this and don't require extra code and support.

### Permit content - `StdSignDoc`

The data being signed is a cosmos-sdk `StdSignDoc` with some constraints.

```go
// StdSignDoc is replay-prevention structure.
// It includes the result of msg.GetSignBytes(),
// as well as the ChainID (prevent cross chain replay)
// and the Sequence numbers for each signature (prevent
// inchain replay and enforce tx ordering per account).
type StdSignDoc struct {
	AccountNumber uint64            `json:"account_number" yaml:"account_number"`
	ChainID       string            `json:"chain_id" yaml:"chain_id"`
	Fee           json.RawMessage   `json:"fee" yaml:"fee"`
	Memo          string            `json:"memo" yaml:"memo"`
	Msgs          []json.RawMessage `json:"msgs" yaml:"msgs"`
	Sequence      uint64            `json:"sequence" yaml:"sequence"`
}
```

| Field           | Comment                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AccountNumber` | must be `0`                                                          |
| `ChainID`       | free-form, but when signing with Keplr must use the current chain-id |
| `Fee`           | must be `0uscrt` with `1` gas                                        |
| `Memo`          | must be an empty string                                              |
| `Msgs`          | an array with only one message of the type `PermitMsg`               |
| `Sequence`      | must be `0`                                                          |

Note that `ChainID` can be just a free-form string, but Keplr enforces that it's the current chain-id. The contract doesn't care about chain-id and it just checks that the signature is correct. In practice a user can sign a permit on chain-id `secret-3` and later on send it on chain-id `secret-4` and it will be validated correctly (and that's okay!).

#### `PermitMsg`

`PermitMsg` is the only message allowed in `Msgs`.

```json
{
  "type": "query_permit",
  "value": {
    "permit_name": "<free-form string>",
    "allowed_tokens": ["<address_token_1>", "<address_token_2>", "..."],
    "permissions": ["balance", "history", "allowance"]
  }
}
```

- `type` is always the string `query_permit`.
- `value.permit_name` is a free-form string. The user can later revoke this permit using this name.
- `value.allowed_tokens` is a list of token addresses to which this permit applies.
- `value.permissions` is an array that may contain `balance`, `history` and `allowance`.
  - `balance` - gives permission to query the `balance` of the permit signer.
  - `history` - gives permission to query the `transfer_history` and `transaction_history` of the permit signer.
  - `allowance` - gives permission to query the `allowance` of the permit signer as an `owner` and as a `spender`.

#### Full Example

```json
{
  "chain_id": "secret-4",
  "account_number": "0",
  "sequence": "0",
  "msgs": [
    {
      "type": "query_permit",
      "value": {
        "permit_name": "test",
        "allowed_tokens": ["secret18vd8fpwxzck93qlwghaj6arh4p7c5n8978vsyg"],
        "permissions": ["balance"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "fee": {
    "amount": [
      {
        "denom": "uscrt",
        "amount": "0"
      }
    ],
    "gas": "1"
  },
  "memo": ""
}
```

### Signature

Signature is a JSON object of this type:

```json
{
  "pub_key": {
    "type": "tendermint/PubKeySecp256k1",
    "value": "<33 bytes of secp256k1 pubkey as base64>"
  },
  "signature": "<64 bytes of secp256k1 signature as base64>"
}
```

It's the output of `window.keplr.signAmino()` & `secretd tx sign-doc`, and represents a signature on the permit's content with the secp256k1 private key of the account.
